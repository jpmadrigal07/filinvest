        On January 8, 2007, the Board of Directors approved an annual cash
        dividend payment ratio for the Company’s issued shares of twenty percent
        (20%) of its consolidated net income from the preceding fiscal year,
        subject to the applicable laws and regulations and the absence of
        circumstances which may restrict the payment of such dividends.
        Circumstances which could restrict the payment of cash dividends,
        include, but are not limited to, when the Company undertakes major
        projects and developments requiring substantial cash expenditures or
        when it is restricted from paying cash dividends by its loan covenants.
        The Company’s Board may, at any time, modify such dividend pay-out ratio
        depending upon the results of operations and future projects and plans
        of the Company.
